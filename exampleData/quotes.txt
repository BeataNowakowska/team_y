Just think how happy you would be if you lost everything you have right now, and then got it back again. Frances Rodman
Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead-end. Failure is something we can avoid only by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing. Denis Waitley
Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking. Marcus Aurelius
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. Tom Bodett
